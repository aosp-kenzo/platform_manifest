# AOSP FOR KENZO #

### Installing Repo ###

## Grabbing the source ##

[Repo](http://source.android.com/source/developing.html) is a tool provided by Google that
simplifies using [Git](http://git-scm.com/book) in the context of the Android source.

### Installing Repo ###

```bash
# Make a directory where Repo will be stored and add it to the path
$ mkdir ~/bin
$ PATH=~/bin:$PATH

# Download Repo itself
$ curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo

# Make Repo executable
$ chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
```

### Initializing Repo ###

```bash
# Create a directory for the source files
# This can be located anywhere (as long as the fs is case-sensitive)
$ mkdir WORKSPACE
$ cd WORKSPACE

# Install Repo in the created directory
# Use a real name/email combination, if you intend to submit patches
$ repo init -u https://github.com/aosp-kenzo/platform_manifest -b android-7.1.2
```

### Downloading the source tree ###

This is what you will run each time you want to pull in upstream changes. Keep in mind that on your
first run, it is expected to take a while as it will download all the required Android source files
and their change histories.

```bash
# Let Repo take care of all the hard work
$ repo sync
```

### Preparing to Build ###

```bash

# Set up environment
$ source build/envsetup.sh

# Choose a target
$ lunch

# Build with Gapps and Pixel(Optional)
$ USE_GAPPS=true
$ USE_PIXEL=true

# Build the code
$ make -jX otapackage
```
